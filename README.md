---

AgentProvenance, or AgentProvenance, is a local-first control plane for high-concurrency AI agent rollouts.

It does not try to be a generic sandbox runtime, telemetry collector, or Kubernetes/Ray replacement. Instead, it sits above runtime and telemetry substrates and owns the agent-side rollout semantics that generic infrastructure does not model:

- `run`, `rollout`, `attempt`, and `tool_call`
- snapshot lineage and fork fanout
- best-of-forks selection and winner promotion
- active CPU accounting and burst admission
- telemetry-to-agent-context correlation
- policy decisions, quarantine, taint, and response
- async evidence, provenance, and reproducible replay metadata

AgentProvenance uses Docker today and is designed to plug into Docker, OpenSandbox, Kubernetes, Ray, Firecracker, gVisor, Kata, LoongCollector, Falco, Tetragon, and other runtime or telemetry substrates through capability-gated drivers.

## Why this exists

Modern AI agent workloads are no longer just “run one command in one container.”

Evaluation, RL training, best-of-N sampling, coding-agent repair loops, and tool-using agents can create hundreds or thousands of short-lived sandbox computers. Most of those attempts spend much of their wall time waiting on model calls, package installs, tests, I/O, or external services. Meanwhile, their useful state, runtime behavior, cost, and security evidence are scattered across containers, filesystems, logs, telemetry streams, and agent traces.

AgentProvenance makes the rollout layer explicit.

It answers questions such as:

- Which `tool_call` created this process, file diff, network edge, or artifact?
- Which snapshot did this attempt fork from?
- Is this branch cheap enough to continue?
- Is this winner safe to promote?
- Did runtime telemetry arrive before promotion?
- Which snapshots or descendants are tainted?
- How much active CPU did this run actually consume?
- What evidence is needed to replay or audit this result?

## The core loop

```text
ready snapshot
  -> fork N attempts
  -> reserve burst budget before tool execution
  -> run each strategy in an isolated workspace
  -> collect cost, telemetry, artifacts, and compact evidence
  -> score attempts by result, risk, budget, and cost
  -> wait at the promotion barrier
  -> promote the safe winner or quarantine the tainted branch
```

In CLI form:

```sh
agentprov snapshot create "$SESSION_ID" --type directory --path /workspace --name ready

agentprov rollout start \
  --task examples/tasks/bugfix.yaml \
  --snapshot ready \
  --runtime docker \
  --fanout 3 \
  --strategy 'probe::test -f hello.txt && echo passed::score=contains:passed' \
  --strategy 'fast::printf 42::score=number' \
  --strategy 'slow::sleep 1; echo passed::score=contains:passed'

agentprov rollout winner run-demo-bugfix
agentprov cost show run-demo-bugfix
agentprov graph trace --run run-demo-bugfix
```

## What AgentProvenance owns vs. what it plugs into

| Layer | AgentProvenance owns | External substrate |
|---|---|---|
| Agent rollout | `run`, `rollout`, `attempt`, `tool_call`, best-of-forks, promotion | Agentix, trainers, evaluators, coding agents |
| State | snapshot DAG, fork lineage, taint, artifact lineage, replay metadata | Docker workspace copy today; future OverlayFS, reflink, block COW, VM snapshots |
| Economics | active CPU windows, idle discount, BurstGuard, warm reuse, cost per run/attempt/tool call | OS, cgroups, Docker stats, Kubernetes/Ray resource envelopes |
| Risk | telemetry-context correlation, policy decision, response, quarantine, forensics trigger | Falco, Tetragon, LoongCollector, eBPF, runtime events |
| Runtime | capability-gated execution intent | Docker now; future OpenSandbox, gVisor, Firecracker, Kata, Kubernetes, Ray |
| Evidence | compact events, provenance graph, async bundles, replay metadata | local SQLite/filesystem today; future external stores |

## What works now

The current repository is a local-first MVP. It currently supports:

- Docker-backed sandbox sessions
- streaming exec and process records
- local preview URL proxy
- directory snapshot, fork, and resume
- template → ready snapshot → attempt workspace lineage
- rollout fanout and best-of-forks, including Docker-backed short-lived attempt sessions via `--runtime docker`
- winner selection by risk, budget, score, and cost instead of exit code alone
- budget-aware probe-to-top-k rollout pruning
- rollout cost summary with executed/pruned/saved ratio
- BurstGuard admission before synchronized tool phases, with default reject and optional delay/queue policy
- Docker CPU profile switching between `think` and `tool`
- promotion barrier with evidence drain, risk finalization, and taint rejection
- active CPU / idle / wall-time cost accounting
- async evidence and cleanup pipeline
- explainable attempt evidence for pruned and promoted rollout branches
- strategy artifact capture from attempt workspaces into `.acf/artifacts/`
- artifact provenance edges from attempt/tool_call to exported artifact refs
- I/O-aware snapshot planning with source policies: `latest-ready`, `smallest-delta`, `local`, and `untainted`
- MVP policy decisions, quarantine, provenance trace, and forensics export
- run-local provenance trace for snapshot planner explanations
- capability-gated runtime drivers with Docker active and gVisor/Firecracker/bubblewrap as explicit stubs

## Current boundaries

AgentProvenance is intentionally narrow at this stage:

- Docker is the only fully active runtime backend.
- Directory snapshot/fork/resume is supported; memory snapshots are not.
- Scheduler/admission is single-node and conservative, not a distributed placement service.
- eBPF/Falco/Tetragon/LoongCollector integration is planned; current telemetry is wrapper/runtime-level MVP telemetry.
- Egress policy currently covers HTTP/HTTPS proxy workflows and direct-egress blocking from the Docker sandbox bridge; it is not yet a general raw TCP policy engine.
- Baseline detection is MVP-level event and cost counting, not syscall ML or full eBPF feature modeling.

## Quickstart

Prerequisites:

- Go 1.23+
- Docker Desktop or a compatible Docker daemon

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ByteYellow/AgentProvenance
cd AgentProvenance

go build ./cmd/agentprov

./agentprov init

LEASE_ID=$(./agentprov lease create --task examples/tasks/bugfix.yaml)
SESSION_ID=$(./agentprov session create --lease "$LEASE_ID")

./agentprov exec "$SESSION_ID" --stream -- sh -lc 'echo hello > hello.txt'
./agentprov snapshot create "$SESSION_ID" --type directory --path /workspace --name ready

./agentprov rollout start --task examples/tasks/bugfix.yaml --snapshot ready --runtime docker --fanout 3 \
  --top-k 2 \
  --strategy 'probe::test -f hello.txt && echo passed::probe=test -f hello.txt && echo passed::score=contains:passed' \
  --strategy 'fast::printf 42::probe=printf 42::score=number' \
  --strategy 'slow::sleep 1; echo passed::probe=echo 1::score=contains:passed'

./agentprov rollout winner run-demo-bugfix
./agentprov cost show run-demo-bugfix
./agentprov graph trace --run run-demo-bugfix

./agentprov session rm "$SESSION_ID"
```

## Demos

Focused demos are kept as shell scripts so they can double as smoke tests:

```sh
./scripts/demo_preview_url.sh

SESSIONS=50 ./scripts/demo_v01_50_concurrency.sh
```

See [docs/mvp.md](docs/mvp.md) for command-by-command walkthroughs.

## Command surface

### Daemon mode

```sh
agentprov daemon serve --listen 127.0.0.1:8574
export ACF_DAEMON_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8574
```

Daemon sampling is bounded and windowed:

```sh
agentprov daemon serve \
  --sample-interval 5s \
  --sample-limit 64 \
  --sample-timeout 2s \
  --raw-retention 10m \
  --max-raw-samples 512
```

Raw Docker stats are treated as short-term input. Scheduler and cost views read 10s/60s resource windows instead of scanning unbounded raw samples.

### Core workflow

```sh
agentprov init
agentprov lease create --task examples/tasks/bugfix.yaml
agentprov session create --lease <lease_id>
agentprov session cpu-profile <session_id> --profile think
agentprov exec <session_id> --stream -- <command...>
agentprov port expose <session_id> <port>

agentprov snapshot create <session_id> --type directory --path /workspace --name ready
agentprov snapshot plan ready
agentprov snapshot plan ready --policy smallest-delta
agentprov fork ready --count 3
agentprov snapshot resume ready --lease <lease_id>

agentprov rollout start --task examples/tasks/bugfix.yaml --snapshot ready --runtime docker --fanout 3 \
  --top-k 2 \
  --strategy "probe::test -f task.yaml && echo passed::probe=test -f task.yaml && echo passed::score=contains:passed" \
  --strategy "score::printf 42::probe=printf 42::score=number" \
  --strategy "slow::sleep 1; echo passed::probe=echo 1::score=contains:passed"
agentprov rollout winner <rollout_id_or_run_id>

agentprov attempt best-of --snapshot ready \
  --max-fanout 3 --top-k 1 --max-cost 1 --early-stop \
  --strategy "probe::printf 42::probe=printf 42::budget=2::score=number::artifact=probe.txt" \
  --strategy "full::pytest -q::probe=test -f task.yaml && echo 1::budget=30::score=contains:passed::artifact=pytest.log"

agentprov cost show <run_id>
```

### Security, telemetry, and provenance

```sh
agentprov egress allow example.com
agentprov credential inject --run <run_id> --session <session_id> \
  --name github-token --host api.github.com --value <secret>

agentprov process list --session <session_id>
agentprov process inspect <process_id>

agentprov telemetry list --run <run_id> --type network_deny --tool-call <tool_call_id>
agentprov policy test examples/events/metadata-egress.jsonl --rules examples/policies/default.yaml
agentprov policy decisions --run <run_id>

agentprov graph trace --run <run_id>
agentprov graph trace --artifact <artifact_ref>
agentprov graph trace --attempt <attempt_id>
agentprov graph trace --tool-call <tool_call_id>
agentprov graph trace --process <process_id>
agentprov forensics export <run_id>
```

`graph trace` includes run-local `snapshot_plans` so rollout debugging can show
which snapshot source was selected, which copy/resume plan was used, and why
unrelated rollout snapshots were excluded. It can also reverse-trace an
artifact ref, attempt id, tool call id, or process id back to the producing
attempt, tool call, process, rollout, policy decision, evidence, and winner
status. Local rollout attempts and Docker-backed execs both emit process-linked
events, so RL rollout evidence can start from either the attempt/tool call layer
or the runtime process layer.

### Runtime and fleet signals

```sh
agentprov runtime list
agentprov runtime inspect docker

agentprov node register --address localhost --runtime docker --cpu 8 --memory-mb 8192
agentprov node list
agentprov scheduler status

agentprov pool create --template bugfix --size 2 --seed-workspace ./seed --max-size 2
agentprov pool status

agentprov cost sample <session_id>
agentprov bench overcommit --sessions 20 --idle-ratio 0.8 --bursty --physical-cpu 8
```

## Architecture

The long-term shape is an Agent Rollout Control Plane with six AgentProvenance-owned planes and pluggable substrates underneath:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Client["Agentix / trainer / evaluator / agentprov"] --> Ingress["Fleet Ingress Gateway"]
    Ingress --> AgentProvenance["AgentProvenance Control Plane"]

    subgraph AgentProvenance["AgentProvenance Control Plane"]
        Rollout["Rollout Plane\nrun, rollout, attempt, tool_call\nfanout, best-of, budget"]

        Evidence["Evidence Plane\nprovenance graph, forensics\nasync GC and replay metadata"]
        Driver["Driver Plane\nruntime, orchestrator\ntelemetry, snapshot drivers"]
    end

    Rollout <--> Economics

    Runtime --> Kernel["Host kernel / cgroup / namespace boundary"]
    Kernel --> Telemetry
    Telemetry -->|"filtered high-value events"| Risk
```

AgentProvenance owns rollout semantics, not generic infrastructure. Runtime, orchestrator, snapshot, and telemetry implementations are queried through a capability matrix before execution. If a backend cannot do memory snapshot or low-latency resume, the scheduler must degrade to filesystem/directory fork instead of pretending the capability exists.

| Plane | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Rollout | `run`, `rollout`, `attempt`, `tool_call`, fanout, best-of-forks, promotion |
| State | Template, ready snapshot, attempt workspace, snapshot DAG, taint lineage |
| Economics | Active CPU windows, burst admission, warm reuse, snapshot physical cost, budget |
| Risk | Telemetry-context correlation, policy decision, baseline feature, response |
| Evidence | Async provenance graph, forensics bundle, replay metadata, background GC |
| Driver | Capability-gated runtime, orchestrator, telemetry, and snapshot substrates |

## Runtime driver capabilities

Runtime backends are capability-gated. `agentprov runtime list` and `agentprov runtime inspect <backend>` report what each backend can actually do instead of presenting planned adapters as usable.

| Backend | Exec | Stop | Snapshot | Fork | Resume | CPU weight | Memory snapshot | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Docker | yes | yes | directory | directory | directory | yes | no | active |
| gVisor | no | no | no | no | no | no | no | planned stub |
| Firecracker | no | no | no | no | no | no | no | planned stub |
| bubblewrap | no | no | no | no | no | no | no | planned stub |

The Docker driver implements directory-level snapshot, fork, and resume by copying workspace state and then creating a new running session. Memory-level snapshot/restore is intentionally left false until a VM-capable backend exists.

## v0.1 hardening demos

```sh
./scripts/demo_cpu_weight_control.sh
SESSIONS=50 ./scripts/demo_v01_50_concurrency.sh
./scripts/demo_ioaware_snapshot_planner.sh
```

The CPU weight demo verifies the control-plane loop with Docker `CpuShares`: `think=2`, `tool=1024`, then back to `think=2` after exec. On Linux cgroup v2, Docker maps this control path to cgroup CPU weight behavior; a direct `cpu.weight` node-agent writer is a later Linux-specific optimization.

The concurrency demo sets `ACF_BURST_MAX_INFLIGHT` and proves that not every simultaneous tool call is promoted to the high-priority CPU profile. Set `ACF_BURST_OVERFLOW_POLICY=delay` with `ACF_BURST_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_MS` to let excess tool phases wait for a burst slot instead of failing immediately.

The I/O-aware snapshot demo shows hot metadata path detection, I/O fanout rejection, and graph trace reasons for not choosing overlay.

## Roadmap

Near term:

- JSON output mode for automation
- Promotion barrier hardening beyond local evidence drain: external telemetry watermarks and taint freeze
- Snapshot taint propagation
- Stronger process manager and process tree enforcement
- Raw TCP policy enforcement for non-HTTP protocols
- Falco/Tetragon/LoongCollector JSONL telemetry receivers

Later:

- OpenSandbox runtime driver
- gVisor and bubblewrap capability adapters
- Firecracker disk/memory snapshot capability path
- Backend-aware admission and scheduling intent for Kubernetes/Ray/cloud batch
- Rich provenance graph queries and forensics bundles

## Testing

```sh
go test ./...
```

Local runtime state lives under `.acf/` by default and is intentionally ignored. Public docs live under [docs/](docs/); runnable examples live under [examples/](examples/) and [scripts/](scripts/).
