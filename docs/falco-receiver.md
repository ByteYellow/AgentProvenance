# Falco-compatible Receiver

English · [简体中文](zh-CN/falco-receiver.md)

Status: **maintained for compatibility, not a featured path.** The primary
kernel-evidence source is AgentProvenance's own eBPF sensor
(`agentprov sensor stream`). This receiver exists for environments where the
native sensor cannot run (for example, managed clusters where you cannot load your own eBPF) or where Falco is already deployed and filtering
kernel/runtime events — its output can be folded into the same DAG,
correlation, policy, and risk path.

```sh
./agentprov telemetry bind --run run-falco-demo --substrate-scope substrate-falco-demo \
  --execution-scope exec-falco-demo --tool-call tool-falco-demo \
  --process process-falco-demo --container-id container-falco-demo --pid 4242 \
  --started-at 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z

./agentprov telemetry ingest-falco \
  --file examples/telemetry/falco-risk-events.jsonl --json

./agentprov telemetry list --run run-falco-demo
./agentprov telemetry list --run run-falco-demo --limit 100 --json
./agentprov telemetry list --run run-falco-demo --limit 100 --cursor <next_cursor> --json
./agentprov timeline --run run-falco-demo
./agentprov security risks --run run-falco-demo --json
./agentprov security responses --run run-falco-demo --json
```

For a live stream, pipe Falco JSON output directly:

```sh
sudo falco -o json_output=true -o json_include_output_property=true | \
  ./agentprov telemetry ingest-falco --file -
```

The receiver maps Falco process, file, and network rows into normalized runtime
events. Metadata IP, private CIDR, and secret-path rows are promoted into
security evidence: `RiskSignal`, `ResponseAction`, policy graph edges, and
timeline entries. `graph explain --risk <policy_decision_id> --json` links the
risk back to the raw runtime event and forward to the response action. Falco
remains the substrate collector; AgentProvenance owns correlation, causality,
provenance, and risk/audit linkage.

The main smoke path is telemetry correlation and graph explanation:

```sh
./scripts/demo_telemetry_jsonl.sh
```

It binds a ToolCallScope, ingests raw Falco/Tetragon/LoongCollector-style
runtime events that do not carry `tool_call_id`, normalizes them into the event
store, correlates them back to application context, and explains the resulting
causal graph.
