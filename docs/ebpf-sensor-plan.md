# eBPF Sensor Plan (Phase 4: self-owned system telemetry)

> Status: **IMPLEMENTED** and expanded well past the original 3-probe scope
> (`internal/sensor`, `cmd/agentprov-sensor`; Linux, arm64), validated live on an
> arm64 lab VM. The design rationale below is kept as the record; the **As built**

## As built

Probes (all → the normalized schema, ingested as `source=agentprov_ebpf`):

- `execve` (+ argv), `connect` (IPv4), `openat` — **writes and sensitive
  reads** (read of a credential/secret path → `secret_path`), `process_exit`.
- Privilege/tamper: `setuid`/`setgid`, `ptrace`, `rename`/`renameat`/`renameat2`,
  `unlinkat`.
- TLS plaintext: `SSL_write`/`SSL_read` uprobes → `tls_write`/`tls_read` with a
  privacy-safe hash + preview + allow-listed HTTP metadata (never the full body);
  paired into a DAG `llm_call` edge and an `llm_intent_caused` edge.
- DNS: `getaddrinfo` uprobe (glibc).

Key learnings: noise-prefix filtering runs **before** `bpf_ringbuf_reserve` (a
discarded record still occupies the buffer), which removed a containerd-teardown
firehose; output is the **native** normalized schema (decision (b) below);
race-free `container_id` comes from a cgroup-id → cgroup-dir-inode resolver.
The product path is now `agentprov sensor stream`: a per-node supervisor that
streams native events into the local store, correlates them to open bindings,
and evaluates runtime policy without a manual JSONL ingest step.

Open follow-ups: universal DNS (musl / UDP:53), IPv6/UDP, HTTP/2 HPACK decode,
multi-arch (x86 `PT_REGS`; arm64 only today), `ptrace` end-to-end test, and
rootless container cgroup-delegation validation.

## Goal

A small, self-owned Linux sensor that captures the three events the correlation
engine already keys on, and emits them in the **existing normalized telemetry
schema** so the correlation/evidence core needs **zero changes** — the sensor is
just another telemetry source alongside Falco/Tetragon.

## Scope (first cut — deliberately minimal)

Three probes only:

| Event | Probe (CO-RE) | Normalized `event_type` |
|---|---|---|
| process exec | tracepoint `sched/sched_process_exec` (or `syscalls/sys_enter_execve`) | `execve` |
| network connect | kprobe `tcp_connect` (or tracepoint `syscalls/sys_enter_connect`) | `network_connect` |
| file open | tracepoint `syscalls/sys_enter_openat` | `file_open` |

Each event carries the identity the correlation engine needs:
`pid, tgid, ppid, cgroup_id, container_id (derived from cgroup path), timestamp,
+ event-specific fields (cmdline / dst_ip / path)`.

## Architecture

```
[kernel probes] -> BPF ring buffer -> [agentprov-sensor / sensor stream]
                                      -> normalized events
                                      -> ingest -> correlation -> policy/risk -> graph
```

- **Loader:** `cilium/ebpf` (pure-Go, CO-RE). Avoids libbpf at runtime. `bpf2go`
  compiles the `.c` -> `.o` at build time (needs clang/llvm + `vmlinux.h` from
  `bpftool btf dump`). Keeps runtime deps minimal; build deps are clang/llvm only.
- **Binary:** `cmd/agentprov-sensor` and `agentprov sensor stream`, Linux-only
  via `//go:build linux`. A non-Linux stub returns "sensor requires linux" so the
  main module still builds/tests on macOS/Windows.
- **Output contract:** the standalone sensor can still emit normalized JSONL for
  pipes/tests, but `agentprov sensor stream` is the supervised product path: it
  ingests into the local store, applies self-noise filtering, correlates against
  open bindings, and evaluates policy/risk by default. **Resolved → (b):** the
  sensor emits a native normalized schema, auto-detected on `source=agentprov_ebpf`
  by `mapNative` (rather than mimicking Falco/Tetragon shapes), so own-kernel
  telemetry drives the same correlation → policy → risk path.

## Container/cgroup identity

`container_id` is derived from the cgroup path of the event's task (cgroup v2:
`/sys/fs/cgroup/...`; the container runtime encodes the container id in the path,
same as Falco/Tetragon do). This is exactly the key the correlation tiers use
(`cgroup+time` 0.98 / `container+time` 0.92), so events drop straight into the
existing join. In K8s the cgroup path encodes pod/container — no extra work.

For zero-SDK supervised capture, `agentprov record` can create a real cgroup v2
leaf for the launched command. The child and descendants inherit that cgroup, so
host-level eBPF events join to the run by `cgroup_id` instead of by PID polling.
Set `AGENTPROV_CGROUP_PARENT` to a delegated parent such as
`/sys/fs/cgroup/agentprov`, or run the recorder with enough privilege to create
the leaf. On non-Linux or record-only runs, AgentProvenance uses a synthetic
scope id; that is correct when no kernel sensor is present.

## Build / run prerequisites (Linux)

- Ubuntu 22.04+ / Debian 12, kernel **5.15+**, root/sudo (CAP_BPF + CAP_PERFMON).
- `clang llvm libbpf-dev linux-headers-$(uname -r) bpftool make` + Go 1.23.
- `bpftool btf dump file /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux format c > vmlinux.h` for CO-RE.
- Docker/containerd present, to produce real container cgroups for correlation.

## Verification plan

1. Unit-test the event->normalized-schema mapping on any OS (synthetic events).
2. On Linux: run the sensor, exec a command / open a secret path / connect to a
   metadata IP inside a container; confirm events are captured and, after ingest,
   correlate to the ToolCallScope and raise the existing risk signals.
3. Extend `accept_unified_signals_attestation.sh` (or a new accept script) to
   drive the loop from REAL sensor output instead of the synthetic Falco JSONL.

## Boundaries (not in this phase)

- No kernel-side filtering policy language (consume-time policy stays in Go).
- No Windows eBPF. No cross-host aggregation (see north-star scoping decisions).
- Off-host signing/anchoring of sensor output is a later deployment concern.

## Connection mode for implementation

- **A — SSH direct:** Linux reachable from the dev host; build/test driven over
  `ssh`. Provide host/port/user/key.
- **B — copilot:** commands/code authored here, run on Linux, output pasted back.
